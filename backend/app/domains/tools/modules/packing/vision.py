ScopeIt - Packing Tool Vision Service

Provides Claude Vision API integration for photo-based room content analysis.
Ported from moving_estimate standalone application.

Two public service functions:
    analyze_room_photos(room_name, images, existing_items, settings)
        -> RoomAnalysisResponse

    build_master_content_list(rooms)
        -> MasterContentResponse

Both rely on a two-pass Claude API strategy:
    Pass 1 (vision + tool use): Identify every packable item with constrained
        category enums and typed fields. Normalize names via taxonomy.
    Pass 2 (text + tool use): Enrich items with packing method, materials
        (constrained to valid keys), labor estimates, and flags.

Graceful degradation: if anthropic is not installed or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is
not set, both public functions raise HTTPException(503) with a clear message.

{multi_note}{existing_note}
NOTE: The user labeled this room "{room_name}" but IGNORE that label when deciding what items exist. Only report what you ACTUALLY SEE in the image.

RULES:
1. Identify every MOVABLE, packable item — furniture, electronics, boxes, decor, rugs, lamps, books, artwork, bedding, clothing, freestanding appliances, etc.
2. DWELLING vs. CONTENT — apply this test for every item you see:
   EXCLUDE if: removing it requires cutting plumbing/electrical, unscrewing from wall/ceiling, or structural work.
   INCLUDE if: it can be picked up and carried out as-is (even if heavy).

   ALWAYS EXCLUDE (permanently attached to structure):
   - Recessed/pot lights, ceiling-mounted light fixtures, ceiling fans
   - Bathtub, shower, toilet — plumbed into floor/wall
   - Built-in kitchen cabinets (upper/lower wall cabinets screwed to wall)
   - Built-in bathroom vanity cabinet (if wall-mounted/plumbed)
   - Countertops, backsplash, tile
   - Built-in shelving or closet organizers attached to walls
   - HVAC vents, thermostats, smoke detectors, electrical panels
   - Window blinds, shutters, or curtain rods mounted to wall/frame

   ALWAYS INCLUDE (freestanding / removable content):
   - Freestanding kitchen island (sits on floor, not bolted to wall)
   - Freestanding wardrobe, armoire, storage cabinet
   - Refrigerator, stove/range, washer, dryer (appliances — move even if connected)
   - Microwave (countertop or over-range — both are content)
   - Wall-mounted TV (content — it's electronics, just needs unmounting)
   - Curtains/drapes (the fabric itself, not the rod)
   - Freestanding baker's rack, shelving unit, or bookshelf

   AMBIGUOUS — USE VISUAL JUDGMENT:
   - Cabinet: if it looks built into the wall (flush, no gap, no legs) → EXCLUDE. If it's freestanding with visible sides/legs → INCLUDE.
   - Shelving: if brackets are screwed into wall with no way to remove shelf as a unit → EXCLUDE. If it's a standalone unit → INCLUDE.

3. ONLY list items you can visually confirm. If an item is partially covered, list what you can SEE (e.g., a quilt covering something bed-shaped = list the quilt AND the bed). Do NOT guess or infer items based on room type or label.
4. NAME items for PACKING: type + material + size. NO colors, patterns, brands, characters, or location info.
   - INCLUDE size/configuration info that AFFECTS PACKING: "3-Section Sectional Sofa", "6-Shelf Tall Bookcase", "4-Drawer Dresser", "King Bed Frame"
   - GOOD: "3-Section L-Shaped Sofa", "Tall 5-Shelf Wooden Bookcase", "Queen Bed Frame", "Large 3-Door Wardrobe"
   - BAD: "Comfortable Sofa", "Nice Bookshelf", "Big Bed"
5. Scan EVERY area: foreground, background, shelves, floor, walls, corners, on top of furniture.
6. Group ONLY identical small items (e.g. "Photo Frame" qty 3). Each distinct item = separate entry.

CRITICAL - REPORT CONTENTS SEPARATELY FROM CONTAINERS:
- If a bookcase/bookshelf has visible books → list the bookcase as "Furniture" AND list "Book Collection" separately as "Books" with an estimated quantity
- If a dresser has visible clothing → list the dresser as "Furniture" AND list "Clothing Items" as "Clothing"
- If shelves have dishes/kitchenware → list as "Kitchenware" separately
- Items ON TOP of furniture (lamps, decor, electronics) → list each separately

DENSITY RATING — PRIMARY SPACE ONLY:
- If any photo shows a closet, walk-in wardrobe, or attached storage area, inventory those items normally BUT do NOT factor them into the density rating.
- Density must reflect how crowded the MAIN living area feels (open floor space, furniture arrangement), not the total item count across all photos.
- A master bedroom with a packed walk-in closet photo is still "normal" density if the bedroom itself is typically furnished.

SOFA/SEATING SIZE RULES (affects material quantity significantly):
- Standard sofa (2-3 cushions, single piece): quantity = 1
- Sectional sofa with 2 pieces: quantity = 2, name = "2-Section Sectional Sofa"
- Sectional sofa with 3+ pieces: quantity = 3 (or more), name = "3-Section Sectional Sofa"
- Each section = separate packing unit requiring its own cover and blankets

    return f"""You are a professional Content Pack-Out Estimator. Add packing details to these items:

{items_json}

For EACH item, determine:
- needs_disassembly: true only if disassembly is required for transport
- packing_method: step-by-step packing instruction (be specific)
- required_materials: list of material keys needed — REPEAT a key multiple times to indicate quantity needed
- base_labor_hours: fixed setup time (preparing materials, workspace) — does NOT scale with quantity
- per_unit_labor_hours: marginal packing time for EACH single unit
- special_instructions: field notes if needed (null otherwise)
- estimator_flags: applicable flags

CRITICAL — MATERIAL QUANTITY via REPETITION:
Include each material key once per unit needed. Examples:
- Standard sofa (1 piece): ["sofa_cover", "moving_blanket", "moving_blanket", "stretch_wrap"]
  → 1 sofa cover, 2 blankets, 1 stretch wrap
- 3-section sectional sofa (quantity=3, each section is one item):
  → each section gets: ["sofa_cover", "moving_blanket", "moving_blanket", "stretch_wrap"]
- Large armchair: ["chair_cover", "moving_blanket", "stretch_wrap"]
- Large 5-shelf bookcase (the shelf unit itself, books listed separately):
  ["moving_blanket", "moving_blanket", "stretch_wrap"]  → 2 blankets for a tall unit
- Small 2-shelf bookcase: ["moving_blanket", "stretch_wrap"]
- King/Queen bed frame (disassembly required): ["moving_blanket", "moving_blanket", "moving_blanket", "stretch_wrap"]
- Large 3-door wardrobe: ["moving_blanket", "moving_blanket", "moving_blanket", "stretch_wrap"]
- Dresser (4+ drawers): ["moving_blanket", "moving_blanket", "stretch_wrap"]
- TV 50"+: ["tv_box", "bubble_wrap_12", "bubble_wrap_12"]
- Book collection (100 books): set quantity=100 in item, use ["book_box"] once — calculator divides by 15 books/box automatically
- Glass/dish items: ["dish_pack_box", "packing_paper", "packing_paper"]

LABOR MODEL — base_labor_hours + per_unit_labor_hours:
total = base_labor_hours + (per_unit_labor_hours × quantity)

base_labor_hours = fixed setup (preparing materials, workspace). Does NOT scale with quantity.
per_unit_labor_hours = marginal time to pack EACH unit.
